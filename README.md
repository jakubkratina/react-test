# React Test

Implement a feature to allow item selection with the following requirements:

1. Clicking an item selects/unselects it.
2. Multiple items can be selected at a time.
3. Make sure to AVOID UNNECESSARY RE-RENDERS (performance).
4. Currently selected items should be visually highlighted.
5. Currently selected items' names should be shown at the top of the page.
